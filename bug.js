This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  The error might not be immediately obvious because React Native's error handling might not surface it properly.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someStream.subscribe(data => {
    // ...handle data...
  });

  return () => {
    //cleanup
    subscription.unsubscribe(); //This might throw if subscription is already unsubscribed or null
  };
}, []);
```
